Components in React return a piece of JSX code that tells what should be rendered on the screen. 
  There are two types of components:
      1)Functional Components - Simply javascript functions.
      2)Class Components - They work with other components in the program

In React components, code reuse is primarily achieved through compostion rather than inheritance.

Commit Phase                    React updates DOM and refs                                  |
                                |                           |                               |

Render Phase -> Pure and has no side effects. May be paused, aborted or restarted by React.
Commit Phase -> Can work with DOM, run side effects, schedule updates.                            


----Mounting-----

These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
    -> constructor().
    -> static getDerivedStateFromProps().
    -> render().
    -> componentDidMount().

----Updating-----

An update can be caused by changes to props or state.
    ->Props(properties) are arguments passed into React components
